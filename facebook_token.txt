You can get a Facebook access token by following these steps:

Log in to Facebook and go to the Facebook for Developers website.
Click the "Get Started" button in the top right corner.
Select "Build Connected Experiences" and then "Create App ID".
Follow the prompts to create a new app. Choose a name and category for your app, and enter your contact email.
Once your app is created, you'll be taken to the app dashboard. Go to the "Settings" tab and select "Basic".
In the "Basic" settings, you'll see an "App ID" and "App Secret". Copy the "App ID".
To get an access token, you can use the Facebook Graph API Explorer. In the Graph API Explorer, select your app from the dropdown in the top right corner.
Click the "Get User Access Token" button. This will open a dialog where you can choose the permissions your app needs. Select the permissions you need for your app to post to Facebook and click "Generate Access Token".
Copy the access token and use it in your application.
Note that access tokens expire after a certain period of time. You can extend the lifetime of a token using the Facebook API.
