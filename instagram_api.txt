You can obtain the Instagram API endpoint by following these steps:

Log in to the Facebook Developers Dashboard with your Facebook account.
Click on the "Add a New App" button and follow the prompts to create a new app.
Once your app is created, go to the "Instagram" tab and click on the "Basic Display" link.
Click on the "Create New App" button and follow the prompts to create a new app on Instagram.
Once your Instagram app is created, you will see a "Client ID" and "Client Secret" in the "Basic Display" settings. Copy the "Client ID".
In the "Basic Display" settings, scroll down to the "Client OAuth Settings" section and add the following "Valid OAuth Redirect URIs": https://localhost:5000/instagram_callback (assuming you are running your application on localhost:5000).
Save the changes to your Instagram app.
You can now use the following endpoint to obtain an access token for Instagram: https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=https://localhost:5000/instagram_callback&scope=user_profile,user_media&response_type=code (replace CLIENT_ID with the client ID of your Instagram app).
Once you have obtained an authorization code, you can use the following endpoint to exchange it for an access token: https://api.instagram.com/oauth/access_token.
Note that the Instagram API has some limitations and restrictions on what you can do with it. Make sure to read and follow the API terms and policies.
